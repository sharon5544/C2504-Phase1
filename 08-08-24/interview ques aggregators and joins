1. Different types of aggregators functions?
ans.
    a. SUM: Calculates the total sum of a set of values.
    b. AVG: Calculates the average value of a set of values.
    c. MAX: Returns the maximum value in a set of values.
    d. MIN: Returns the minimum value in a set of values.
    e. COUNT: Returns the number of rows in a table or the number of non-NULL values in a column.
    f. GROUPING SETS: Groups a result set into groups based on one or more columns.

2.Write an example for each aggregators?
ans.
    a. SUM
       Example: SELECT SUM(salary) FROM employees;
       -- Calculate the total sales by region
        SELECT region, SUM(sales) AS total_sales
        FROM sales_data
        GROUP BY region;
    b. AVG
      Example: SELECT AVG(price) FROM products;
      -- Calculate the average order value by customer
      SELECT customer_id, AVG(order_value) AS avg_order_value
      FROM orders
      GROUP BY customer_id;

    c. MAX
       Example: SELECT MAX(salary) FROM employees;
    d. MIN
       Example: SELECT MIN(price) FROM products;
       -- Calculate the maximum and minimum prices by product category
      SELECT category, MAX(price) AS max_price, MIN(price) AS min_price
      FROM products
      GROUP BY category;

    e. COUNT
       Example: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM customers;
       
    f. GROUPING SETS
      Example: SELECT department, AVG(salary) FROM employees
      GROUP BY department;

 3.USES OF THE AGGREGATORS IN SQL
ans.
    A.Data Analysis

      b.Providing insights into trends patterns, and correlations.
    B.Reporting
      a.To generate reports, such as sales reports, financial reports
      b.Performance metrics.
    C.Business Intelligence
      a.Business intelligence applications to analyze and visualize data, supporting informed decision-making.
    D.Data Mining
      a.To identify patterns and relationships in large datasets.
    E.Scientific Research
      a.To analyze and summarize data, supporting hypothesis testing and theory development.

4.Define joins in SQL?
ans.
    SQL JOINS are used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them.

5.What are the different types of joins explain with examples?
ans.
    1. 1nner joints
    Returns only the rows that have a match in both tables
    
    SELECT *
    FROM customers
    INNER JOIN orders
    ON customers.customer_id = orders.customer_id;
    
    2.Left joints
    Returns all the rows from the left table and the matching rows from the right table. If there are no matches, the result set will contain NULL values.
    
    SELECT *
    FROM customers
    LEFT JOIN orders
    ON customers.customer_id = orders.customer_id;
    
    3.Right joins
    Returns all the rows from the right table and the matching rows from the left table. If there are no matches, the result set will contain NULL values.
    
    SELECT *
    FROM customers
    RIGHT JOIN orders
    ON customers.customer_id = orders.customer_id;
    
    4.FULL join
    Returns all the rows from both tables, with NULL values in the columns where there are no matches.
    
    SELECT *
    FROM customers
    FULL JOIN orders
    ON customers.customer_id = orders.customer_id;
    
    5.CROSS join
    
    Returns the Cartesian product of both tables, with each row of one table combined with each row of the other table.
    
    SELECT *
    FROM customers
    CROSS JOIN orders;

7. Explain about the join conditions?
ans. 
   a.ON: Specifies the column(s) to join on.
   b.USING: Specifies the column(s) to join on, without the need to specify the table names.
   c.NATURAL: Joins the tables based on all columns with the same names.

8.Key difference between aggregators and joins?
ans.
  a.Purpose: Aggregates are used to perform calculations on a set of data, while joins are used to combine data from multiple tables.
  b.Output: Aggregates produce a single value or a set of summary statistics, while joins produce a combined set of rows from multiple tables.
  c.Syntax: Aggregates use functions like SUM, AVG, and COUNT, while joins use keywords like INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, and RIGHT JOIN.
  
  In summary, aggregates are used to analyze and summarize data, while joins are used to combine data from multiple tables.
